# Who Am I
Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Ransford. I work out of the Genscape office in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. I've been with Wood Mackenzie _(n&eacute;e Genscape)_ since 2012. I've been married since 2000 to my lovely wife Gina. We have two kids: Cole _(our teen)_ and Colin _(our pre-teen)_. Besides those two, our house is filled with animals: Chloe _(the nervous dog)_, Link _(the grumpy cat)_, Peach _(the coy cat)_, and Grace _(the fluffy cat)_.

# What Have I Been Doing
In my time here, I've spent time working on applications in Java, Typescript/Javascript, C#, and Python. Many of the applications that I have worked on focus on back-end, real-time delivery of data to/from message queue systems, but I have also produced front-end and customer-facing applications.
